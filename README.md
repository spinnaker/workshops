## Spinnaker Workshop Labs

**Introduction**

Spinnaker [\(http://www.spinnaker.io\)](https://www.spinnaker.io) is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform built by Netflix in partnership with Google, Microsoft, and others. At Netflix, Spinnaker powers over 4,000 deployments a day. With Spinnaker, you can easily automate complex delivery processes into repeatable pipelines that enable rapid deployments with confidence.

This workshop will provide hands-on experience building continuous delivery pipelines for deploying and promoting code across cloud virtual machines and containers. Weâ€™ll start with a git repository and work together in building repeatable pipelines that take code through packaging, deploying, promoting and rollbacks.

If you'd like a deeper dive into the concepts behind Spinnaker you can check out our [free e-book. ](https://spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/ebook/)
